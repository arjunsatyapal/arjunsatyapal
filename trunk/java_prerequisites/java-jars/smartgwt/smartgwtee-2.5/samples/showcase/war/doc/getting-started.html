    <title>Getting Started with SmartGWT Server DataSource Integration</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Creating a DataSource</h3>
<p>In SmartGWT EE, your DataSource definition provides visual components with a description of the
business object you want to manipulate in the UI, <b>and</b> provides information to the
server-side framework on how your objects will be fetched and persisted.  In some cases, a single
declaration drives both client- and server-side behavior (such as validators).</p>
<p>
A DataSource is declared in an XML file with the suffix ".ds.xml".  If you have existing SQL tables, JPA
/ Hibernate entities, or even Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), you can derive a DataSource
automatically using the <b>autoDeriveSchema</b> or <b>schemaBeam</b> settings.  With these properties, a
one-line DataSource declaration provides all the information Smart GWT EE needs to build grids, forms and
other components that are ready to display and edit your existing entities.  
<P>
Smart GWT will automatically choose editing controls for each field, derive user-visible titles
(getFirstName() or FIRST_NAME becomes "First Name"), apply default formatting and validation rules, and
apply other intelligent defaults based on Java annotations and SQL metadata.  You can then customize from
there, adding fine-grained overrides to the default behaviors wherever necessary, and you never have to
re-declare the automatically derived information.
<P>
For a new from-scratch application or for new entities added to an existing application, you can also 
generate SQL tables or Hibernate persistence settings from your DataSource declaration instead of the
other way around.
<P>
<h3>Loading DataSources</h3>
<p>Once you have a DataSource definition, load the DataSource by including the following line in the body
of your GWT host .html file.
<pre>
            &lt;script src='sc/DataSourceLoader?dataSource=employees,supplyItem'>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
Specify a comma separated list of DataSource ID's for the <code>dataSource</code> parameter. The above
line would load the employees and supplyItem datasources from the server.
<P>
Smart GWT's data-aware components can then be configured to use these DataSources by just calling
setDataSource().

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<P>
Once you've looked through the samples in the Showcase, start with the <a
href="http://www.smartclient.com/product/documentation.jsp">QuickStart Guide</a>.  In addition to setup
instructions, the QuickStart Guide provides key need-to-know information about the major subsystems of
Smart GWT, then provides links to deeper discussions.
